### Install Sublime Text

It's time to install [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

To get started, run the following command in your terminal to check your operating system’s type:

```
uname -m
```
Depending on whether your operating system's type is i386 or x64, follow the guide below.

For i386, run this command:

```
cd ~
wget http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime-text_build-3083_i386.deb
```

For x64, run this command:

```
cd ~
wget http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime-text_build-3083_amd64.deb
```

Now, regardless of your operating system type, run the following command to move the files:

```
sudo mv Sublime\ Text\ 3 /opt/
```
Finally, run this command to create a symbolic link. This will allow you to launch Sublime Text from the Terminal.

```
sudo ln -s /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime
```

Once installed, use the Dash to launch Sublime Text.

Next, navigate to the `Preferences > Settings - User` menu item.

Ensure the file contains the following preferences.

```
{
  "font_size": 18.0,
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true,
  "rulers": [80],
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,
  "update_check": false
}
```

**WARNING:** Punctuation errors with either curly-brackets, double-quotes, colons, square-brackets, or commas will be highlighted in red. If one of these symbols is missing, Sublime Text will highlight the next closest symbol. Analyze the above example preferences carefully. :eyes:

Remember to save the file and you'll see something like this.

When you're done, close the file.


### subl

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Sublime Text from the Terminal.

To verify Sublime Text is wired up correctly, run the following command:

```
subl ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

And Fish's startup file will open in Sublime Text like this.

### Edit config.fish

Many command line tools, like Git, use the `EDITOR` environment variable to open your preferred text editor.

While Fish's startup file is handy, add the following settings.

```
# Sublime Text
set -gx EDITOR 'subl -w'
```

**TIP:** Environment variables, like `EDITOR`, must be written in all capital letters.

Save the file and you'll see something like this.

Now, relaunch the Terminal and verify these settings with the following command.

```
echo $EDITOR
```

**TIP:** Environment variables must be written in all capital letters.

And you'll see something like this.

### Inspect the PATH

Like most shells, Fish relies on the `PATH` environment variable to specify a set of directories where other commands can be found.

To see the contents of the PATH environment variable, run the following command.

```
echo $PATH
```

**TIP:** Environment variables, like `PATH`, must be written in all capital letters.

And you'll see something like this.
